# Overview

This is a simple calculator app, that is meant to be really easy to use and be very simple and clutter free. You first enter a number on the first line,
and then a second number on the second line. From there you chose one of the four basic arithmetic buttons (add, subtract, multiply and divide) to preform
the calculation. The number will be displayed as a pop-up message towards the bottom of the phone.

I created this app to be able to have some sort of experience in mobile app development. While it is not the fanciest calculator,
I wanted to do something very simple, to be able to learn the mechanics and workings of how mobile app design and Kotlin work together. 
I also wanted to make sure I made something that I could go back and build upon, while still understanding what I had done. 
I chose a calculator because I thought it would be a more simple app, that could be used by anyone who wanted to, and I could make it how 
I would want a calculator to look and feel.

# Development Environment

I chose Android Studio as my IDE for this project. I chose to use it because I was interested in developing an android based app. 
I also have a familiarity with Kotlin and wanted to put that new found language to implementation into an app. 
I was able to use Android studio for the making of the app, and Kotlin to write all of the logic for the app.

# Future Work

* Create a better layout of the calculator on the screen
* Have a better output of the information (like an output box)
* Add mor features, such as intractable number buttons, so th insure doe not have to type.
